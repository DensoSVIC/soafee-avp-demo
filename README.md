# SOAFEE Blueprint - Autonomous Valet Parking Demo

The [avp/](avp) folder in this repository is a fork of the Autoware.Auto [Autonomous Valet Paerking Demonstration](https://autowarefoundation.gitlab.io/autoware.auto/AutowareAuto/avpdemo.html). It has been adapted to use the [Lingua Franca](https://lf-lang.org) orchestration lanugage, and to be configured on local or cloud hosts using the blueprint tools in [DensoSVIC/soafee-avp-blueprint](https://github.com/DensoSVIC/soafee-avp-blueprint).

See [DensoSVIC/soafee-avp-blueprint](https://github.com/DensoSVIC/soafee-avp-blueprint) for documentation on how to build and deploy the source code in this repository.
